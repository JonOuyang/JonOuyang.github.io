## Introduction

MOIRAI is an in-progress project exploring a lightweight plugin that turns a room full of collaborators into a single live coding surface, where people can discuss, sketch, and iterate while an AI vibe coding agent translates the conversation into working code.

## The Core Idea

Think of a meeting room where everyone is brainstorming a feature, and the shared ideas are instantly reflected in the codebase. MOIRAI aims to stitch voice, notes, and real-time edits into a single collaborative flow, so the gap between discussion and implementation shrinks to seconds.

## Collaboration Flow

The experience is meant to feel fluid rather than formal. Participants can propose changes, refine the approach, and approve the direction while the agent keeps pace. MOIRAI is intended to prioritize momentum and shared understanding over heavy process.

## Tool Compatibility

The plan is to make MOIRAI compatible with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenAI Codex so teams can keep their preferred agent while sharing a common collaboration layer. Each integration would focus on live context exchange and consistent, real-time updates in the session.

## Project Status

MOIRAI is currently a work in progress with details intentionally left flexible. The immediate focus is to validate the experience and shape the collaboration model before committing to a concrete implementation.
